# My interests

When it comes to my interests, there's no shortage of passion and curiosity driving me forward. I'm completely obsessed with climbing – there's something about the physical and mental challenge of scaling new heights that keeps me hooked. And of course, my love for Linux and open-source software knows no bounds. From tinkering with different distributions to advocating for the power of open-source solutions, it's a world I'm deeply entrenched in.

But my interests don't stop there. I'm fascinated by the world of containerization and orchestration, diving into the realms of Docker and Kubernetes to streamline and optimize processes wherever I can. And when I'm not knee-deep in code or clinging to a rock face, you'll likely find me buried in a stack of IT books or losing myself in the pages of fiction novels. I believe in the power of continuous learning, whether it's to deepen my understanding of technology or simply to escape into another world for a while.

Outside of the tech realm, I have a passion for mountaineering, seeking out new summits to conquer and breathtaking vistas to behold. And when it's time to unwind, there's nothing like kicking back with some good music or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. Whether I'm cooking up a storm or exploring new musical genres, I find joy in the simple pleasures of life that complement my adventurous spirit and insatiable curiosity.

## Climbing

It all began with bouldering, a casual invitation sparking a newfound passion. The challenge and thrill captivated me instantly. Yet, the global crisis hit, halting my climbs temporarily.

With restrictions easing, I transitioned to rope climbing, embracing new challenges and techniques. Now, as I scale natural rock outdoors, each ascent is a symphony of exhilaration and freedom. Climbing isn't just a hobby—it's a journey of self-discovery and resilience, fueling my soul with every climb.

## Linux

My fascination with Linux began in school, where I was captivated by its open nature and endless possibilities. Since 2019, I've made it my daily driver, immersing myself in the world of Arch Linux to explore its inner workings and understand the Linux kernel on a deeper level. Now, I'm excited to take the next step in my Linux journey by delving into native Linux application development, eager to harness the power of this incredible platform to create software that makes a difference.

## Homelab

At the heart of my home sits my pride and joy—a self-built server humming with the possibilities of open-source software. Here, I find solace in tinkering with both hardware and software, constantly pushing the limits of my knowledge.

Linux serves as the bedrock of my homelab, providing the foundation for my experiments with containers. From Docker to Podman to Kubernetes, each tool is a gateway to new challenges and discoveries.

But more than just a technical playground, my homelab is where I embrace the thrill of learning by doing. It's a space where I turn curiosity into action, tackling obstacles head-on and emerging stronger with each success and failure.

In this ever-evolving journey, my homelab isn't just a hobby—it's a reflection of my passion for innovation and my commitment to constant growth. And as I navigate the twists and turns of technology, I find comfort in knowing that my homelab will always be there, ready to fuel my curiosity and drive for years to come.

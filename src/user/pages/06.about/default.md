### About me

Born and raised in the stunning region of South Tyrol, I've always had a knack for getting lost in the world of technology. It all started with a curiosity that led me down the path of computer science, eventually landing me in a vocational school where I immersed myself in all things IT.

But life isn't just about coding and debugging, right? In my downtime, I stumbled upon the exhilarating world of bouldering and climbing. Not only did it give me an adrenaline rush like no other, but it also introduced me to an awesome crew of friends who share my passion for adventure.

When I'm not scaling cliffs or tackling coding challenges, you can find me tinkering away on my home server. Hosting my own open-source services has become a hobby of mine â€“ there's something incredibly satisfying about setting up and maintaining everything from email servers to file-sharing platforms, all while championing the principles of open-source software.

And then there's my girlfriend â€“ she's too perfect to be true. With her by my side, I truly share the joy of life. Every day, she supports me in ways I never thought possible and gives me the strength to tackle any challenge that comes my way. She's not only my partner, but also my best friend and greatest supporter.

Speaking of coding, it's more than just a job for me â€“ it's a creative outlet. Whether I'm building sleek web applications or diving into the depths of backend development, there's nothing quite like the thrill of bringing ideas to life through lines of code.

Switzerland has always held a special place in my heart, with its stunning landscapes and cutting-edge tech scene. After wrapping up high school, I dove headfirst into the world of software engineering at a local company. But my dreams don't stop there. I'm itching to dive into university life in Switzerland, all while continuing to make waves in the tech industry.

Life's a journey, and I'm just getting started. Who knows where the next adventure will take me? But one thing's for sure â€“ I'll be armed with my passion for tech, a thirst for excitement, and the unwavering support of my incredible girlfriend every step of the way. ðŸš€

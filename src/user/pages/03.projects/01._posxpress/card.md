POSxpress is a dynamic solution built with Angular, NestJS, and Node.js, tailored for clubs gearing up to host lively events and festivals. Simplifying the process of managing food orders, POSxpress is your go-to platform for seamless order processing.

As an admin, take control of your offerings by effortlessly adding products and specifying ingredients that can be added or removed. Assign prices to your items and configure thermal printers with custom tags, ensuring efficient order management. For instance, you can designate printers to handle specific categories like food or drinks, streamlining kitchen operations.

For waitstaff, POSxpress provides a user-friendly interface to swiftly navigate tables, take orders, and make modifications such as removing ingredients or adding notes. With the ability to adjust order quantities quickly, waiters can provide efficient service while keeping track of the total price. Payment options allow for flexibility, whether customers choose to settle bills separately or collectively.

Upon payment confirmation, orders are promptly dispatched to designated printers, allowing chefs to commence food preparation without delay. POSxpress ensures a seamless flow from order placement to fulfillment, enhancing the efficiency of your event operations.

I can't showcase the printing since the request is normally sent to a real thermal printer without many interaction.

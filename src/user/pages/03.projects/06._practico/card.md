Welcome to our school project, an internship portal where we delve into the world of web development. Powered by PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JS, this platform is our collective endeavor to learn and create. Companies can insert internship positions while students like us practice searching and applying. With PHP handling the backend and MySQL storing data, we're immersing ourselves in the world of databases and dynamic web content. HTML, CSS, and JS add flair to the user interface, making this project both educational and enjoyable.

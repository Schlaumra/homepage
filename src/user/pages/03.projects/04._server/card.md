Step into my self-built home server, where innovation meets reliability. This server isn't just a piece of hardware; it's a testament to the endless possibilities of DIY technology.

Equipped with RAID for data redundancy and reliability, this server ensures that your data remains safe and accessible at all times. But the magic doesn't stop there. With an automatic Rocky Linux installation using a kickstart file, setting up and configuring the server is a breeze.

To streamline management and configuration, Ansible takes the reins, automating tasks and ensuring consistency across the board. From initial setup to ongoing maintenance, Ansible simplifies server management, freeing up time for more important endeavors.

But what truly sets this server apart is its role as a playground for innovation. With Podman at its core, this server hosts a myriad of containers, each serving a unique purpose. From Nextcloud for seamless file synchronization to various other services, this server is a hub of productivity and collaboration.

But that's not all. This server is also a testing ground for cutting-edge technologies. Kubernetes, tested using Minikube and ArgoCD, offers insights into the future of container orchestration and deployment.

And the journey doesn't end here. Planned projects include the setup of a Mastodon server for social networking, a Matrix server for decentralized communication, an email server for personalized communication, and a Wireguard VPN for secure remote access.

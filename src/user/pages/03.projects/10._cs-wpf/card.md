My journey in C# programming has been a dynamic exploration:

1. Building Blocks: I started with the basics, immersing myself in object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts through practical projects.
2. Desktop Adventures: I ventured into desktop application development with WPF, where I learned to create polished interfaces that combined functionality with aesthetic appeal.
3. Brief Web Excursion: While my focus was primarily on desktop applications, I briefly explored web development with ASP.NET, gaining insights into its capabilities and potential. Later I discovered Blazor and watched shortly into it.

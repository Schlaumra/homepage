Welcome to YARD - Yet Another Remote Desktop. This project is a labor of love, born from a deep interest in networking and a desire to understand it at its core. Developed in Python, YARD utilizes raw TCP and UDP protocols, providing an opportunity to explore the intricacies of network communication firsthand.

The protocol implemented in YARD is entirely self-crafted, serving as a valuable learning experience in designing and implementing communication protocols. While not all communication within YARD is encrypted, security remains a priority, with TLS encryption employed for sensitive data exchanges.

YARD offers a unique feature allowing connections through a discovery server, enabling users to connect without requiring an IP address. Utilizing generated client IDs and passwords, users can securely connect to other clients, enhancing accessibility and ease of use.

The user interface of YARD is built using TKinter, offering a straightforward experience for users to interact with. From screen capturing to transmitting mouse and keyboard inputs, YARD provides a comprehensive solution for remote desktop access.

One of the notable aspects of YARD is its cross-platform compatibility. Whether you're using Windows or Linux, YARD bridges the gap, enabling seamless remote desktop connections across different operating systems.

Moreover, YARD incorporates NAT traversal techniques, including UDP hole punching, to overcome network obstacles and ensure reliable communication in diverse networking environments.

YARD is not just another remote desktop solution; it's a journey into the world of networking and protocol design. Join us in exploring the depths of network communication with YARD.
